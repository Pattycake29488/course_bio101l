**Unit 3: Cells** <span id="3"></span> 
*Cells are the basic unit of life.  In this section, you will learn
about cell structure and how cells are studied.  We will begin with
instruction on microscope use, and then study the basic cell types.  An
understanding of the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic
cells will be emphasized.  *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 4 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe the structure and components of cell types.
-   Identify cell types and structures under the microscope.
-   Design experiments to determine the function of organelles.

     Instructions: Please click through these two tutorials to learn
    about compound light microscopes. The first tutorial will simply
    name the different parts of the microscope.  The second tutorial
    explains how microscopes are used in the laboratory, and includes
    examples of cell images as seen under a microscope.
